Polarity is a Stablecoin Exchange Platform.

It leverages user familiarity by using USDT (Tether USD) as the exchangesâ€™ base pair,
not Bitcoin, making the experience closer to legacy finance.

It is run on a decentralized network for the vast security benefits it provides users and our own company.

      Polarity is built off the Waves.Exchange 1.0 code, which was adapted 
      for the Turtle Network DEX and then made into Polarity.Exchange.
