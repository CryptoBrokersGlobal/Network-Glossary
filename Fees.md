<b> We made these choices for the convenience of our userbase, we do not believe anyone
should be required to make seperate purchases for network fuel to use any of our
services, or blockchain level services. </b>

Gateway Fees

        Gateway fees has a Fees tab inside the Polarity client, which list withdrawal fees
        and trade fees in the native asset price (non USDT fees)
        
ERC-20 Costs

        While it is not ideal to pay such large amount for token transfers outisde of the exchange,
        this unfortunately is our of our control. We pass on the cost of network fees to the users 
        directly.
