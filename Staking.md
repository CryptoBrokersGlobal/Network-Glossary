Staking: utilizing tokens native protocols for network validation, resulting in rewards to participants.

  TurtleNetwork is an LPoS network. 
  
    Leased Proof of Stake:
      Users delegate their balance to a network generator (node) who
      distributes mined proceeds proportionally to "leasers".
      
  The reward rate is variable and relies entirely upon the amount of network activity (transactions).
  
  TurtleNetwork blockchain does not have any inflation mechanics and is fixed supply.
  
    At the current moment Staking is not enabled in the Polarity wallet, but will be enabled in the future.
